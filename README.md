# Hi, I'm Shreyas Nikte 👋

📍 **Netherlands ↔ Germany ↔ India**

>  A product guy with a little data and software background. Devloping tools which help me (or could have helped me in past). AI is commoditizing software. Cost-Per-Effort will get passed to the end user.

### 🛠️ Current Projects
* **[incometax.nl](https://incometax.nl)**: Privacy-first salary & capital gains tax calculator for the NL.
* **[Dutch Box 3 Tax calculator - npm Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dutch-tax-box3-calculator)**: NPM package for calculating Dutch Box 3 tax calculations
* **Version Control for the rest of us**: (Stealth)

### 📜 Legacy Work
* **[Kesho Bot](https://github.com/shreyasnikte/kesho-telegram-bot)**: Telegram bot for remote control of music playing on another device on your LAN.
* **Meteorite Watch**: A guide on how to build on your own meteorite automatic watch (not on github yet)

### 🤝 The big fat why
* I am a geek who did not follow the traditional software or data engineering stream. As a result, I face problems which are adjecent to software industry but still not addressed by the software community.
* That leave me with one choice - fix my own problems. I try and many times fail (there is a graveyard of unfinished projects). Sometimes it works out well!
